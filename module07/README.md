## Description
This module is designed to help the student understand Templates in CPP.
## Subject
### [ex00](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module07/ex00): Start with a few functions
Implement three function templates ('swap', 'min', 'max'), which can be called with any type, as long as the types of both arguments are the same and they support all comparison operators.\
(first intro to function templates)
### [ex01](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module07/ex01): Iter
Write a function template 'iter', which takes in the address of an array (any type of array must work), the length of the array and a function to be called on all elements of the array. The third parameter can be an instantiated function template.\
(a more extensive function template & using instance of a function template in another template)
### [ex02](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module07/ex02): Array
Develope a class template 'Array', containing elements of type T. Write multiple constructors, creating an array and allocating memory. Oveload subscript operator [].\
(first look into class templates)
