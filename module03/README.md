# module03
## Description
This module is designed to help the student understand Inheritance in CPP.
## Subject
### [ex00](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module03/ex00): Aaaaand... OPEN!
Implement a specific robot class named ClapTrap, that will later be used as a parent class for other Trap-like robots.\
(orthodox canonical class form)
### [ex01](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module03/ex01): Serena, my love!
Implement a ScavTrap class, that derives from the ClapTrap class and inherits ClapTrap's constructors and destructors. Some of the member function are the same as in the ClapTrap class, but work differently.\
(first, simple intro to inheritance)
### [ex02](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module03/ex02): Repetitive work
Implement a FragTrap class, inheriting from ClapTrap class. Constructor and destructor have to be different from ClapTrap class.\
(understanding how constructors & destructors work between related classes)
### [ex03](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module03/ex03): Now itâ€™s weird!
Implement a DiamondTrap, that is a ClapTrap, but also inherits from ScavTrap AND FragTrap.\
(understanding 'Diamond/Multiple Inheritance')
