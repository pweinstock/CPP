# module06
## Description
This module is designed to help you understand the different casts in CPP.
## Subject
### [ex00](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module06/ex00): Conversion of scalar types
Write a program that takes a string representation of a scalar type and convert it to it's actual type, than explicitly to the three other data types. You need to handle char, int, float and double.\
(conversion of scalar types)
### [ex01](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module06/ex01): Serialization
Write a serialize() and a deserialize() function, converting a pointer to a struct to type uintptr_t and vice versa.\
(short intro to serialization of data types)
### [ex02](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module06/ex02): Identify real type
Implement a Base class and three inheriting classes A, B, C. Write a function that randomly instanciates A, B or C and returns it as a Base pointer. Write functions that print the actual type of a Base* or Base&, without using typeinfo header, or pointers in these functions.\
(first steps into identification of different objects and their type)
