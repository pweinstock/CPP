### [ex01](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module00/ex01): My Awesome PhoneBook
Write a program that behaves like a "crappy awesome phonebook software" from the 80s. On program start-up, the phonebook is empty and the user is prompted to enter one
of three commands. The program only accepts ADD, SEARCH and EXIT. Once a command has been correctly executed, the program waits for another one. It stops when the user inputs EXIT.
### [ex02](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module00/ex02): The Job Of Your Dreams
From the content of tests.cpp and Account.hpp, re-engineer how the 'account class' was implemented and code the Account.cpp yourself.
