# module02
## Description
This module is designed to help the student understand Ad-hoc polymorphism, overloads and orthodox canonical classes in CPP.
## Subject
### [ex00](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module02/ex00): My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form
Create a class in Orthodox Canonical Form that represents a fixed-point number.\
(first intro to the 'Orthodox Canonical Class' form; Gain deep knowledge about the internal workings behind ints, floats and fixed-point numbers)
### [ex01](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module02/ex01): Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
Embalish your fixed-point class with different constructors, member functions and overload of "<<"(insertion) operator.\
(understand function and operator overloading)
### [ex02](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module02/ex02): Now weâ€™re talking
Add public member functions to fixed-point class to overload the following operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, +, -, *, /, i++, ++i, i--, --i. Also add 4 overloaded static member functions min and max.\
(Deep dive into operator overloading)
### [ex03](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module02/ex03): BSP
Implement a function which uses your fixed-point class and indicates, whether a point is inside of a triangle or not.\
(understand the concepts behind 'Binary Space Partitioning')
