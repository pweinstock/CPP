# module08
## Description
This module is designed to help the student understand templated containers, iterators and algorithms in CPP.
## Subject
### [ex00](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module08/ex00): Easy find
Write an 'easyfind' template accepting two parameters - a type T and an int. Assuming T is a container of integers, this function has to find the first occurrence of the second parameter (int) in the first (T).\
(easy dive into the STL with containers and iterators)
### [ex01](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module08/ex01): Span
Develop a 'Span' class, able to store up to 'N' integers. Write an 'addNumber()' function, as well as a function adding a number of integers, and two functions returning the shortest and the longest span between between all numbers stored. Test with at least 10.000 numbers.\
(learn how to look into STL containers and search for specific functionalities)
### [ex02](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module08/ex02): Mutated abomination
The std::stack is one of the few containers, which are NOT iterable. Thus implement a 'MutantStack', which has all of the std::stack's features, but with the added bonus of iterators.\
(deeper look into containers and iterators)
