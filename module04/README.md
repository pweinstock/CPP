# module04
## Description
This module is designed to help the student understand Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces in CPP.
## Subject
### [ex00](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module04/ex00): Polymorphism
Implement an animal class, as well as a Dog and a Cat class, inheriting from the animal class and having their specific sounds. Also implement a a WrongAnimal and a WrongCat class, to check how polymorphism can go wrong.\
(intro to polymorphism)
### [ex01](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module04/ex01):  I donâ€™t want to set the world on fire
Implement a Brain class and give Cat and Dog a 'private Brain (pointer)' attribute. Also create an array of Animals (half Cats/half Dogs), which are destroyed at the end of your program.\
(understanding the difference between 'deep' and 'shallow' class copies)
### [ex02](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module04/ex02): Abstract class
Fix the Animal class so nobody can instantiate it.\
(intro to 'abstract classes')
### [ex03](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module04/ex03): Interface & recap
Write AMateria class, and its 2 concrete classes Ice & Cure. Create concrete class Character, which can equip and unequip Ice & Cure objects. Also write a MateriaSource class, which is able to learn new AMateria 'templates' if needed.\
(first use of 'interfaces' (since we use CC++98, we use 'pure abstract classes')
