## Subject
### [ex00](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module05/ex00): Mommy, when I grow up, I want to be a bureaucrat!
Code a 'Bureaucrat' class, with a grade in a specific range. If someone tries to instanciate a Bureaucrat with an invalid grade, throw an exception.\
(intro to exceptions and exception classes)
### [ex01](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module05/ex01): Form up, maggots!
Implement a class 'Form', which is only signable holding a Bueraucrat with a specific grade. If Bueraucrats grade too high or low, throw the corresponding exception.\
(catching and using the exceptions return in a function)
### [ex02](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module05/ex02): No, you need form 28B, not 28C...
Change 'Form' class to abstract class, and write 3 sub-classes with different behaviour, to implement different exceptions.\
(repetition of C++ file manipulation & exception handling in sub-types)
### [ex03](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module05/ex03): At least this beats coffee-making
Create an 'Intern' class with a 'makeForm(arg a, arg b)' function. If 'arg a' exists, the function will return a Form object with name 'arg a' and target initialized to 'arg b'.\
(repetition of exception handling, switch statement and function pointers)
