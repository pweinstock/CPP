# module01
## Description
This module is designed to help the student understand the memory allocation, reference, pointers to members and the usage of the switch in CPP.
## Subject
### [ex00](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module01/ex00): BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ
Implement a Zombie class and write a short C++ program, that uses two functions to create new zombies. One returning a zombie instance, and one that doesn't return anything. Determine in what case itâ€™s better to allocate the zombies on the stack or heap.\
(first intro to 'new' and 'delete')
### [ex01](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module01/ex01): Moar brainz!
Write a program that creates a "horde of Zombies", checks if the Zombie instances function well, and deletes them.\
(first intro to the difference between 'delete' and 'delete[]')
### [ex02](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module01/ex02): HI THIS IS BRAIN
Write a program that manipulates a string via pointers and references.\
(first intro to the concept of 'references')
### [ex03](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module01/ex03): Unnecessary violence
Implement a weapons class, and a human class, that may use this weapon. Create a human who is always armed and one, that is NOT necessarily always armed.\
(understand when to use 'references' and when to use 'pointers')
### [ex04](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module01/ex04): Sed is for losers
Create a program that will open a file and copies its content into a new file, replacing every occurrence of s1 with s2.\
(using C++ file manipulation for the first time & use more std::string functions to manipulate a string)
### [ex05](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module01/ex05): Karen 2.0
Implement a class, that displays debug/info/warning/error messages dependent on the level handed over by the main().\
(understanding the use of 'pointers to member functions')
### [ex06](https://github.com/pweinstock/CPP/tree/master/module01/ex05): Karen filter
Dependent on the level of the error messages from ex05, Create a program that takes as parameter one of the four levels. It will display all messages from this level and above.\
(first intro to the 'switch' statement)
